This is the customization directory where you can make changes to your installation of flatHUD.

A bit of an FAQ is located below.

Q: How do I install these?
A: Take the file inside the folder and drag it into your resource/ui folder.  If it asks you to overwrite anything,
say yes.  Reload TF2 and enjoy!

Q: Is this it (customization options)?
A: At the time.  I hope to add in more choices through community input.

Q: Okay, so how do I give my feedback?
A: Post on the tftv thread (http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/14664-flathud) and I'll get around to you eventually.
That thread, the website, and the github are the only places
to get flatHUD.  Any gamebanana or tf2mods threads are NOT MINE.


Thanks for using flatHUD.
