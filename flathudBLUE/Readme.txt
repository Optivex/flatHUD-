FAQ:

Q: How do I install?
A: Drag and drop the flathud master folder into your tf/custom folder.  If you are running 4:3 open the 4:3
folder in flathud master and drag and drop the files inside into flathudmaster/resource/ui.

Q: I have [x] bug.  How do I report this?
A: Report it to me through the tftv thread (http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/14664-flathud).  This is the only
place you can contact me about this.

Q: My fonts are weird.  What do I have to do?
A: This most likely means you didn't install the fonts correctly.  Navigate to your flathud/resource folder and install
the fonts "big_noodle_titling" and all the ones beginning with "weblysleek".  This should fix your problem.

Q: How do I use Fog's Xhairs?
A: http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/14702-release-fogs-crosshairs-v3 This is the thread for Fog's xhairs, he has a tidy
little tut for all of you.
